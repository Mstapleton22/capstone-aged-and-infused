## Problem Statement

	As media, marketing and imagery continue to command control from online users, breaking 
	
	into business and still find a way to excite the consumer is no longer novelty. In order to 
	
	engage customers and in turn, dive sales - Small Businesses must be tactile in their 
	
	approach to liven up their products. We do this through technology. To enrich the alcohol 
	
	infusion process by allowing consumers to create customizable infusions with the intent to 
	
	use them in predefined and obscure cocktails. With ease, we are providing users with 
	
	allergies, or different taste to find the right infusion to suite their needs.
